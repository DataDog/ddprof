## things by pid

DsoHdr
-- DSO

Lookups
-- pid / bin maps
-- mappings
-- runtime

DwflHdr
-- DwflWrapper
-- Visited pids

## Not by pid
#############
-- File info (dso_hdr)
-- Lookup
Dwarf symbol lookup
-- Symbol table

## Async profiler

parseLibraries parses everything in proc self.

### Step 1 -- ensure we can have one code array per PID


### Step 2 -- ensure symbols are shared across PIDs


### Step 3 -- ensure unwinding tables are shared across PIDs



### Junk notes
Write an API that can work with ddprof object model

LoadSymbolTable loads at a given base address
We want to store all symbols at an elf address

1) Rewrite parseLibraries <Hard>
we can use DSO information + file info
Ensure the cache is at elf address (not base)
Start is 0 or for non PIE,


2) Find library is by absolute address
- Keep that ?



### Issues

- We are moving from a lazy to an absolute load
- We don't have enough tests
