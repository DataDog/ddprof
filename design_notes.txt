Dwarf symbol lookup


## Async profiler

### SymbolLinux
parseLibraries parses everything in proc self
Instead, write an API that can work with ddprof object model

LoadSymbolTable loads at a given base address
We want to store all symbols at an elf address

Oh wow, everything is added in a weird code blob
Oh wow, native func is stored in a char and we deduce pointer from the offset to the name

1) Rewrite parseLibraries
we can use DSO information + file info
Ensure the cache is at elf address (not base)
Start is 0 or for non PIE,


2) Find library is by absolute address
- Keep that ?
